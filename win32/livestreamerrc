# By default livestreamer will attempt to locate VLC on your system
# and use that, but you can also specify the location of a player
# yourself.

# Important: You must use a quoted path if there are spaces in the path. This
# is because the player command is parsed like a shell command to allow
# parameters to be passed to the player.

# Here is a few examples of players:

# VLC
#player="C:\Program Files (x86)\VideoLAN\VLC\vlc.exe"
#player="C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC\vlc.exe"
# Using --file-caching is recommended, but is only supported in VLC 2.0+
#player="C:\Program Files (x86)\VideoLAN\VLC\vlc.exe" --file-caching=5000
#player="C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC\vlc.exe" --file-caching=5000

# MPC-HC, must be at least version 1.7 to be used
#player="C:\Program Files (x86)\MPC-HC\mpc-hc.exe"

# MPlayer2
#player=C:\mplayer2\mplayer2.exe -cache 4096


# Show console output from video player
#verbose-player

# RTMP streams are downloaded using rtmpdump, full path to the rtmpdump exe
# should be specified here.
rtmpdump=@INSTDIR@\rtmpdump\rtmpdump.exe

# Log level, default is info
#loglevel=debug
